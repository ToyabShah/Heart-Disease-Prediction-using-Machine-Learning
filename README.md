# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

A project to predict heart disease using the Heart Disease Dataset. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, and model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) with a Streamlit app for deployment. Random Forest achieved perfect precision. Contains Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit app code, saved model (`disease_model.pkl`), and project report (.pdf).

- Run the notebook: `Heart_Disease_Assignment.ipynb`
- Launch the app: `streamlit run app.py`
