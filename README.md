# **Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using the **Heart Disease Dataset**. It involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model training** with multiple machine learning algorithms, including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.  

The **Random Forest model achieved perfect precision**, making it the most reliable for prediction. The project also includes a **Streamlit web application** for real-time disease prediction, allowing users to input their health parameters and receive instant results.  

### **Project Contents**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (`Heart_Disease_Assignment.ipynb`) – Contains the full implementation, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.  
- **Streamlit App** (`app.py`) – A user-friendly interface for making predictions.  
- **Saved Model** (`disease_model.pkl`) – The trained Random Forest model used in the application.  
- **Project Report** (`.pdf`) – A detailed analysis of the methodology, findings, and model performance.
